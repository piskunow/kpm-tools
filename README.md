KPM Tools is an open-source Python package that extends the Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) functionalities of [Kwant](https://kwant-project.org/), a popular software for quantum transport simulations in tight-binding models. Our package specifically enhances the KPM expansion capabilities within the realm of closed tight-binding systems.

## Features

- Advanced KPM expansion of typical spectral functions like Density of States, Green's Functions, Kubo Conductivity, and Chern Markers.
- Extremely efficient time evolution operator expansion
- Additional functionalities like KPM vector factories producing tiles, and velocity and distance operators adapted to periodic boundaries.

## Requirements

- Python >=3.9
- Kwant >= 1.4.4

## Installation

### Installing KPM Tools

You can install _KPM Tools_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```console
$ pip install kpm-tools
```

### Important Note on Kwant Dependency

While _KPM Tools_ requires Kwant to function, direct installation of Kwant via pip can sometimes be problematic due to its specific build requirements. To ensure a smooth setup, we recommend the following installation approach:

1. **Try installing with pip (optional):**

   You can attempt to install Kwant along with KPM Tools via pip:

   ```console
   $ pip install kpm-tools[kwant]
   ```

   If this installation fails, proceed to the next step.

2. **Install Kwant using Conda or follow Kwant's installation guide:**

   We recommend using Conda to install Kwant, which typically handles its build requirements more reliably:

   ```console
   $ conda install -c conda-forge kwant
   ```

   Alternatively, refer to the [Kwant installation page](https://kwant-project.org/install) for detailed instructions on installing Kwant in different environments.

After installing Kwant, you can then install KPM Tools using pip as shown above.
